This is the fourth place algorithm that I ran at the Chicago AWS Summit. 
I had only trained it for two hours will have to see if the model can inprove on the 10.930 time after more time in the sim.

Reward Algo
def reward_function(params):
    '''
    Example of rewarding the agent to stay inside the two borders of the track
    '''
    
    # Read input parameters
    all_wheels_on_track = params['all_wheels_on_track']
    distance_from_center = params['distance_from_center']
    track_width = params['track_width']
    marker = 0.5 * track_width
    
    # Give a very low reward by default
    reward = 1e-3

    # Give a high reward if no wheels go off the track and
    # the agent is somewhere in between the track borders
    if all_wheels_on_track:
        reward = 2.0
    elif distance_from_center <= marker:
        reward = 1.0
    else:
        reward = 1e-3

    # Always return a float value
    return float(reward)
